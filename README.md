Welcome to my second project, the Europe quiz website is a landing page for people who like quizzes and are motivated to test or improve their knowledge about European countries and its capitals.

## Features

### Navigation

The navigation bar consits of two links - quiz and highscore. The quiz is the most prominent featuere therefor, it appears already on the landing page.
Due to responsive design requiremets the behaviour and position of the navigation bar is slightly different for different devices. I.e. there is an over effect for the desktop version for mobile not.

Mobile view: Elements are aligned to the center. burger tab is not used. The multiple choice answers are organized on top of each other by using the standrad div logic.

Tablet view: Elements are aligned to the center. Toggle is not used, hover effect is available.The multiple choice answers are organized in a row.

Desktop view: Elements are aligned to the center. Toggle is not used, hover effect available. The multiple choice answers are organized in a row. 

There are three media query breakpoints used: (320px), 768px, 992px

### The head elements
Title and logo are above the navigation. The title says EUROPE and the logo finalize the title with letters Q, U I and Z in a box. Depending on the media query the header gets slightly bigger (font-size: 105%). The content in the header is consitent through all three pages. It cotains two links and a styling for the active site.

#### Features:

| Slider | The slider enables the user to quickly define and change his game experience. He can choose between 20 and 40 questions which takes care of the users time schedule and he can decide whether he has to guess the correct capital or country. The visual effect is generated by using css and due to the position active or deactive the function saveModeSettings() applies the relevant rule | <img src="images_README/slider_active_deactivated.PNG" alt="image shows activated slider above, deactivated slider below"> |
| Button to start quiz | By pressing the button the function start_quiz() is initiated. As a consequence of the div 'quiz settings' (containing sliders) disappears by using style.visibility = 'hidden'. The question and multiple choice questions are generated based on the input of the user. | <img src="images_README/start_quiz_button.PNG" alt="image shows start quiz button"> |
| Shuffle function | To keep up the interest and challenge of the user every new round the order of the questions is random by using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. In addtion, it is reused again for shuffling the multiple choice answers to avoid also here a consistency.| <img src="" alt="image shows questions ands answers"> |
| Timer | To challenge the user even more there is a timer which starts to count down from 20 seconds after each questions. When the counter counts ti 0 the game is over. In addition, the user gets additional points for each saved second. This encourage the user to speed up and get rewarded. | <img src="images_README/index_count_remaining_seconds.PNG" alt="image shows the timer"> |

### The Footer
The footer contains a link to the creator's GitHub and Linkedin link. 


## UX Design
Colorful, plain and simple design. Show a map in the background to introduce the user to the topic - it's geography. The colors of a classic map are used.

 The design was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.


### Color Scheme
The colors used are mostlly aligned with the background and typical colors used on a map. Blue for water, beige for landscape and red, grey for cities and borders. The text color is dark grey and black to provide a userfriendly contrast.

- backgrounds #ffffff, #fce89a

- water blue: #79c9e7, #a6dbef, #58afd9
- land green #a0cf50, beige #fad27f, brown #c0643d
- accents #
- logo, illustrations #
- font color #252525, #000000 #918e8e

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called ''
- Font Awesome icons were used, for GitHub links in the footer
- further icons/ illustrations used from [Freepik.com ](https://www.freepik.com/) and [Picjumbo.com](https://picjumbo.com/)
